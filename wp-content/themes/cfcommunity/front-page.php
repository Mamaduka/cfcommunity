                        <p><strong>Just kidding, you already knew that.</strong> There's always a bunch of stuff going on that only others with CF truly understand. With CFCommunity we've created a place where we can hang out and talk about all the things that make life with CF different/awesome/lame/special. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Hanging out online is not as good as throwing real life rave parties all across the world, but sadly that plan was scrapped early in our brainstorming process (segregation, pseudomonas blablabla). Instead we wasted blood, sweat and salty salty tears on creating an online meeting place where we would like to hang out and meet others with CF. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>On CFCommunity you can create your profile, start a blog, talk to others with CF and share pictures of your cat nebulizing (that's a joke. don't actually do that!)</strong>. It's kinda similar to Facebook but 100% less lame and with 100% more privacy! It's just for people affected by CF and we've made it easy to find and connect with people in similar situations as you.
                        </p>

                        <p>Due to segregation rules it's very hard for patients from the same hospital to ever meet. With CFCommunity we are building a platform where any hospital can very easily create a shared space for patients to talk amongst each other or with hospital staff. This is currently already done by some hospitals through Facebook but we strongly believe that Facebook is the wrong place for this due to lack of privacy and an commercial agenda. </p>

                          When you create a discussion groups for your hospital a member of your staff has full control of who enters the group. Only after a person has been approved to enter the group the content will be viewable. Additionally your staff can upload documents/brochures to the group which can then directly be viewed by everyone inside the group.

            <strong>People with Cystic Fibrosis are not allowed to have contact with one another.</strong> It increases the chance of lung infections and has the potential to reduce life expectancy.
            Now imagine that thousands of others also share this genetic disease but you won’t ever be able to meet with them in person. You won’t be able to get together to share stories, a shoulder, a helping hand, a hug, or build a community of support and encouragement.
            </p>
            <p>
            Online, however, we can interact and engage as much as we want. Online we can create a community and a support network. Online we can make friends. Being around people who truly understand you is important. This realisation is what sparked our ambition to create something for us; the Cystic Fibrosis community. This is why we created CFCommunity.

            <p>
            CFCommunity is 100% dependent on donations! We have managed to start our dream project thanks to many donations from friends, family and people affected by Cystic Fibrosis all across the world. We are now an officially registered cause in the Netherlands and any donation for our cause would be amazing.
