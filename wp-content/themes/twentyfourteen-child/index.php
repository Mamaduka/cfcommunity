		The guy you see in the picture above is me, Bowe Frankema. Some of you might know me as "the BuddyPress guy" that hangs around WordCamps/BuddyCamps and keeps yapping about building communities. Not many of you know that I also have Cystic Fibrosis; a crappy disease that impacts my life expectancy and messes up my lungs and digestive system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cystic Fibrosis causes constant lung infections and your lung capacity deteriorates over time. Most people with CF need a lung transplant later in life, but due to long waiting lists this often comes to late. The average life expectancy for someone with Cystic Fibrosis is 35 years.
		</p>
		<p>
During the last two years I’ve lost four friends due to CF. Five people in my group of friends have needed a lung transplant to stay alive. In short; Cystic Fibrosis sucks.</p>
		<p>	<blockquote>I’m in an unique position to create something meaningful for those affected by Cystic Fibrosis. I can do this through my work with WordPress & BuddyPress and with the support of our community.</blockquote>
		</p>
<p>

<h2>People with Cystic Fibrosis can't meet; We can't have WordCamps</h2>

<p>
Studies have shown that it’s dangerous for people with Cystic Fibrosis to hang out in real life. <strong>We can’t have WordCamps</strong>. We only have the internet to connect. Kids growing up with Cystic Fibrosis these days never even come into contact with each other. Because of a high susceptibility to lung infections, we can easily infect each other just by hanging out.</p> 
<blockquote>
Highly resistant bacteria can be shared between those with CF that can lead to serious declines in lung function and more vicious illnesses that are harder to treat, ultimately reducing life expectancy
</blockquote>
<p>
I want to create a place online for us, the Cystic Fibrosis community. Not only for my friends also for young kids with CF that are growing up now. For their parents who are often just as isolated from meeting others in the same position as them.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>We need an international community like this. Not Facebook. No commercial software. A place by people with CF, for people with CF. 100% build on Open Source software.</blockquote>
</p>

<h2>CFCommunity.net: An community for people with Cystic Fibrosis</h2>
<img src="http://cfcommunity.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/updates-1024x731.jpg" alt="image">
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
The idea is simple: A social network for people with CF, by people with CF. Powered by WordPress/BuddyPress and with a Multisite setup so people can create their own sites. We can be part of a group of people that know what it’s like to have CF or be around someone who has it, without running the risk of cross-infection.
</blockquote>

It will not only be a place where you meet others with CF, it can also serve as the way for a younger generation to learn more about their disease through meeting kids who are in the same position. As someone who’ve had the luxury to meet others with CF in real life, I know how important this is.
